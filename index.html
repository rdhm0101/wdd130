    <p>"Guatemala has several white-water rivers that have excellent rafting. These rivers have rapids that range from Class II to Class V, and many of the rivers pass jungles, hot springs, caves, and even Maya ruins. The best rafting rivers are the Río Cahabón, Río Candelaria, and Rio Chiquibul. These tours are thrilling and available for both experienced and inexperienced rafters. They offer travelers a wonderful way to see places in Guatemala that are otherwise inaccessible."</p>
